        "\n",
        "Congratulations! You've successfully:\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Built a complete RAG pipeline with CloudFlow documentation\n",
        "✅ Implemented LLM-as-Judge evaluation with structured outputs\n",
        "✅ Evaluated 18 questions across 3 core metrics\n",
        "✅ Analyzed results with detailed reasoning and visualizations\n",
        "✅ Understood cost and performance trade-offs\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **LLM-as-Judge provides transparency**: Unlike black-box metrics, you get detailed reasoning for every score\n",
        "2. **Flexibility is powerful**: You can define custom metrics for your specific use case\n",
        "3. **Cost-effectiveness**: At ~$0.10 per run, it's affordable for development and testing\n",
        "4. **Complementary approach**: Use alongside Ragas for best of both worlds\n",
        "\n",
        "## Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Experiment with different judge prompts** to see how they affect scoring\n",
        "- **Compare results with Ragas evaluation** (Notebook 10)\n",
        "- **Test on your own RAG system** with custom documents and questions\n",
        "- **Validate judge scores** against your own human evaluations\n",
        "- **Explore other metrics** like correctness (with ground truth) or tone/style\n",
