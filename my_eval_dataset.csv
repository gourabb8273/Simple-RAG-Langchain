Use pagination for large result sets (recommended page size: 50-100 items). Implement request compression using gzip to reduce bandwidth.\n\nConnection Management: Reuse HTTP connections with keep-alive headers. Maintain a connection pool with 5-10 concurrent connections per API key.

1.  **Caching Strategy**: Implement caching at multiple levels, using CloudFlow's built-in Redis cache for frequently accessed data with a TTL between 5-60 minutes. Also, cache API responses on the client side and respect Cache-Control headers.
2.  **Request Optimization**: Batch multiple operations into single API calls when possible. Use pagination for large result sets with a recommended page size of 50-100 items. Implement request compression using gzip to reduce bandwidth.
3.  **Connection Management**: Reuse HTTP connections with keep-alive headers. Maintain a connection pool with 5-10 concurrent connections per API key. Set appropriate timeouts: a connection timeout of 10s and a read timeout of 30s.
4.  **Query Efficiency**: Use field filtering to request only required data (e.g., `/resources?fields=id,name,status`). Leverage server-side filtering instead of retrieving all data and filtering locally.

What's the difference between Standard and Premium tier rate limits?,"['OAuth 2.0 authenticated requests have separate, higher limits: 5,000 requests per hour for Standard tier.', 'CloudFlow API Rate Limiting\n\nCloudFlow implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and platform stability. Rate limits vary by pricing tier and authentication method.\n\nStandard Tier: 1,000 requests per hour per API key. Burst capacity allows up to 100 requests per minute. Exceeding limits returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests).\n\nPremium Tier: 10,000 requests per hour per API key with burst capacity of 500 requests per minute. Premium tier also includes priority request processing.\n\nEnterprise Tier: Custom rate limits negotiated based on usage patterns. Typically starts at 100,000 requests per hour with dedicated infrastructure.\n\nRate limit headers are included in every response:\n- X-RateLimit-Limit: Maximum requests per hour\n- X-RateLimit-Remaining: Remaining requests in current window\n- X-RateLimit-Reset: Unix timestamp when the limit resets\n\nWhen rate limited, the Retry-After header indicates how many seconds to wait before retrying.

How does OAuth 2.0 authentication differ from API key authentication in CloudFlow?,"['CloudFlow API Authentication\n\nCloudFlow APIs support two authentication methods: OAuth 2.0 and API Keys. Both methods provide secure access to platform resources.\n\nOAuth 2.0 is recommended for user-facing applications. It supports the Authorization Code flow and provides access tokens valid for 1 hour and refresh tokens valid for 30 days. To implement OAuth 2.0, direct users to the authorization endpoint at https://auth.cloudflow.io/oauth/authorize with your client_id and redirect_uri parameters.\n\nAPI Keys are ideal for server-to-server communication and background jobs. Each API key has the format ""cf_live_"" followed by 32 alphanumeric characters. API keys never expire unless explicitly revoked.\n\nTo authenticate requests, include your API key in the Authorization header: ""Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"". All API requests must be made over HTTPS; HTTP requests will be rejected with a 403 error.', 'API keys can be scoped to specific permissions (read, write, admin) and restricted to specific IP addresses for enhanced security. You can manage your API keys through the CloudFlow dashboard or the /api/v1/keys endpoint.', 'OAuth 2.0 authenticated requests have separate, higher limits: 5,000 requests per hour for Standard tier.', 'CloudFlow Security Features\n\nSecurity is a top priority at CloudFlow. We implement industry-leading security practices to protect your data and applications.\n\nEncryption: All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption. Data in transit uses TLS 1.3 with perfect forward secrecy. Encryption keys are rotated every 90 days using AWS KMS.\n\nNetwork Security: CloudFlow runs in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with strict network segmentation. Public endpoints are protected by Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules that block common attack patterns. DDoS protection is provided by Cloudflare with mitigation capacity up to 50 Gbps.\n\nAccess Control: All resources support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with customizable roles and permissions.
